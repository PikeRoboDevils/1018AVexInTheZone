/*
 * Runs the user autonomous code. This function will be started in its own task
 * with the default priority and stack size whenever the robot is enabled via
 * the Field Management System or the VEX Competition Switch in the autonomous
 * mode. If the robot is disabled or communications is lost, the autonomous task
 * will be stopped by the kernel. Re-enabling the robot will restart the task,
 * not re-start it from where it left off.
 *
 * Code running in the autonomous task cannot access information from the VEX
 * Joystick. However, the autonomous function can be invoked from another task
 * if a VEX Competition Switch is not available, and it can access joystick
 * information if called in this way.
 *
 * The autonomous task may exit, unlike operatorControl() which should never
 * exit. If it does so, the robot will await a switch to another mode or
 * disable/enable cycle.
